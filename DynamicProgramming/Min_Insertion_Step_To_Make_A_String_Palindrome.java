/**
 * 1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome
 * Given a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of steps to make s palindrome.
 *
 * A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "zzazz"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we do not need any insertions.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "mbadm"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "leetcode"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 500
 * s consists of lowercase English letters
