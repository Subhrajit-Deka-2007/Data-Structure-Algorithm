 841. Keys and Rooms
 There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.
 When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.
 Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.



 Example 1:

 Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
 Output: true
 Explanation:
 We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
 We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
 We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
 We then visit room 3.
 Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
 Example 2:

 Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
 Output: false
 Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.


 Constraints:

 n == rooms.length
 2 <= n <= 1000
 0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
 1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000
 0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
 All the values of rooms[i] are unique.
